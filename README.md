A Minimalist, Pointer-Centric Language.

‚ÄúDo what you wish, but clean up after your existence.‚Äù

dot (.) is a low-level, expressive, minimalist programming language designed to embody clarity, control, and accountability through symbolic syntax. It compiles to clean C code, and ultimately machine code, while enforcing strict memory and scope discipline.

## Ethos
Only pointers exist. There are no variables ‚Äî only references to memory.

Scope is sacred. You must explicitly release memory when you're done. Nothing leaks.

Functions don‚Äôt return. They transform what they are given ‚Äî inputs are outputs.

Everything must justify its existence. Unused pointers? Compilation error.

Minimal syntax, maximal intent. The language is symbolic, concise, and expressive.

### Key Concepts
|-Concept-|---------------Meaning---------------|	   
|i_ 'x = 1;|'x|Pointer to memory containing 1|
|''x|Dereference|Access the value at pointer 'x|
|'3'array|Access the 4th element in pointer 'array|
|'x\;|Explicitly release pointer 'x|
|f('p) {}|Function: transforms memory; no return values. Only accepts references to memory|
|f('p) {|Function declaration without definition|
|set name{}|Namespace-like: groups related transformations|

## Example
plaintext
Copy
Edit
i_ 5'array;
'0'array = 10;
'1'array = 20;

i_ 'sum = 0;

f(i_ 'arr, i_ 'out){
    i_ i = 0;
    while(i < 2){
        ''out = ''out + 'i'arr;
        i = i + 1;
    }
}

f('array, 'sum);
print(''sum);

'array\;
'sum\;
Transpiles to clean C:

c
Copy
Edit
int* array = malloc(5 * sizeof(int));
array[0] = 10;
array[1] = 20;

int* sum = malloc(sizeof(int));
*sum = 0;

void f(int* arr, int* out) {
    int i = 0;
    while(i < 2){
        *out = *out + arr[i];
        i++;
    }
}

f(array, sum);
printf(\"%d\\n\", *sum);
free(array);
free(sum);
‚öôÔ∏è Compilation
The language is compiled using .., a minimalist build tool.

No headers. No imports. No macros.
Instead, a single file (e.g., .dotbuild) defines directory structure and dependencies.

[build]
entry = main.dot
dirs = src/, lib/

[link]
strict_duplicates = true
auto_import = true

..
## Design Goals
Clarity: Nothing implicit. Every symbol has meaning.

Discipline: You own memory. The compiler enforces it.

Efficiency: Clean transpilation to C/C++ ‚Äî fast, small binaries.

Scope autonomy: Scope is defined by a simple principle: you wield it however you wish.

## Status
Basic syntax and transpiler prototype complete
Expanding function sets, conditionals, and strict validation
Future: direct LLVM backend, REPL, .dotbuild system

ü§ç **Creator‚Äôs Note:**
dot was born from a life shaped by constraint, vigilance, and the need to leave no trace. It‚Äôs a language for those who feel their memory like a room they must clean before they leave.
If this speaks to you, you're already part of it.
